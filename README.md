# Deep Learning Architecture Reading Group (DLARG)

## Purpose: 

Welcome! This reading group is dedicated to research papers on deep learning, and in particular models and architectures that stand out in the landscape as salient and seminal contributions to the field. 

The current main theme of the reading group is "Attention for Natural Language Understanding."

We approach these architectures with a special interest in the practicality and scalability of each model -- especially compute and time, and hence monetary cost to train. 


## Format:
    - Every two months, approximately, the group selects a paper to read. The members read the paper ahead of the reading group meeting. No one is presenting the material, so everyone is expected to prepare! 
    - For each paper, we expect to need two or three 90 minute sessions on consecutive weeks.  
    - Ideally, we can cover a paper in two sessions structured as follows:
        - SUMMARY: The members draw straws, a random person begins by offering a 2-3 sentence summary of the paper. The group discusses and refines this summary and adds to the notes for that specific paper.  (15 min)
        - PROS & CONS: Going around the group, each attendant has a chance to mention what they like and dislike about the paper. These points are added as PROS & CONS in the paper notes.  (10 min)
        - READ-THROUGH: The group goes through the paper, section by section, all members have a chance to ask questions, comment, and discuss each part. During this phase, unknown and important terms should be noted and single-sentence, accesible definitions should be noted in the paper notes. These terms are organized into "key feature terms" that are important for this specific paper, and "technical background terms", which are relevant in the field, generally. Both can be added to an accumulating dictionary. (45 min)
        - ARCHITECTURE: The group goes through in more detail the specific model/architecture and develop a pseudocode expression of the model as described by the paper. Add to paper notes. (20+90 min)
            - Draw diagram? Add to paper notes.
